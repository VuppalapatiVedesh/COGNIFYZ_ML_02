Task: Restaurant Recommendation System

Objective:
To develop a content-based restaurant recommendation system that suggests
restaurants based on user preferences such as cuisine type, price range,
and customer ratings.

Dataset:
A shared restaurant dataset containing details such as cuisines,
price range, and aggregate ratings. The dataset is located in the
Dataset folder and is used across all tasks.

Approach:
- Selected relevant features related to user preferences
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding
- Applied feature scaling to ensure balanced similarity computation
- Used cosine similarity to measure restaurant similarity
- Implemented recommendation functions based on restaurant similarity
  and explicit user preferences

Evaluation:
The recommendation system successfully suggests restaurants with
similar attributes, demonstrating effective content-based filtering.

Conclusion:
This task demonstrates how content-based recommendation systems can be
built using restaurant attributes to provide personalized suggestions.
